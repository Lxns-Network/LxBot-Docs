## Get QQ Group bot
> Please ignore step 2 if using in private chat.
1. Join the feedback QQ group: **1151290186**.
2. Private chat with the administrator and give the group number to request a whitelist
::: theorem Whitelist requirements
1. No advertising groups, promotion groups, or other groups with a pyramid scheme or illegal nature
2. Minimum group size of 10 people
   <br>*Please use the private chat command instead, or go to the whitelisted group chat to use it.*
3. The applicant must be the owner or administrator of the group you wish to apply to
4. the group chat is visible in the search, i.e. the search method is set to allow search
   <br>*The whitelist can be amended after it has been reviewed and approved.*
5. Group chats are not added as "no one is allowed to join the group"
   <br>*The whitelist can be amended after it has been reviewed and approved.*
:::

3. Type `/b ping` in the feedback group to check for currently available LxBots
4. Add friends to the target LxBot and pull them into a group that is **whitelisted**.
   <br>*Note: pulling a LxBot into a non-whitelisted group will automatically reject it. <br> *
   <br>[I have confirmed that I have whitelist permissions, but trying to pull LxBot into the group did not respond](/faq/#I have confirmed that I have whitelist permissions - but trying to pull LxBot into the group did not respond)
5. Getting started, see [Using Bot](#Using-Bot)
